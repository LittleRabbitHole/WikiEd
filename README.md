Abstract: 

Studies in conventional organizations suggest that institutionalized socialization – the integration of newcomers through a formalized on-boarding program – improves their satisfac-tion, production and commitment. Whether institutionalizedsocialization has similar effects online has not been examinedsystematically. This paper evaluates the Wikipedia Education program, an online program that encourages college students to write Wikipedia articles as class assignments and incorporates many elements of institutionalized socialization. Analysis of 16,328 student editors in 770 Wiki Ed classes shows thatWiki Ed students editors were associated with better productivity and commitment compared to newcomers who joined Wikipedia independently. Further, students in classrooms with more joint activities, one element of institutionalized socialization, exhibited productivity.  However, they also stopped contributing to Wikipedia sooner than those in classrooms with an individualistic assignment. We discuss the results through relevant theories and design implications on how socializationcan be applied more effectively.
